# hello-world

My first repository! 

I am an outgoing, confident and responsible psychology student that has a record of success and is able to communicate with people at all levels. I am structured, organised and disciplined in my approach to work, and I achieved a 2:1 in my first year of university. I feel equally at home working under my own initiative or as part of a team.
